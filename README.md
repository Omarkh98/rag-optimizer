# üöÄ Rag-Optimizer

**A Modular Framework for Optimizing Retrieval Strategies in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems**

---

## üìö Overview

This repository contains the core implementation for the thesis project titled:

> **‚ÄúOptimization Strategies for Balancing Accuracy and Responsiveness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation‚Äù**  
> conducted at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg (FAU).

The objective of this work is to research, implement, and evaluate advanced retrieval optimization techniques for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems ‚Äî focusing on adaptive hybrid retrieval, query-type classification, and retrieval strategy selection to improve both accuracy and responsiveness.

## üß† Features

- **Adaptive Hybrid Retrieval**  
  Dynamic routing of queries based on their classified type to the most appropriate retrieval method (dense, sparse, hybrid, filtered vector search).

- **Query Optimization Techniques**  
  Implementation of advanced strategies including query expansion, self-query rewriting, and hybrid filtering to enhance the quality of retrieved context.

- **Modular & Extensible Architecture**  
  Designed for easy integration with existing RAG pipelines and seamless testing of various retrieval strategies.

- **FAU-Ready**  
  Tailored for real-world university administrative scenarios but adaptable for broader knowledge domains.
